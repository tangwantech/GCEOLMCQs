	        "Occurs in somatic cells"
	      ],
	      "wordAnswer": "Creates genetic diversity",
	      "explanation": "Meiosis is significant because it creates genetic diversity. Through the processes of crossing over and independent assortment, meiosis generates genetically unique daughter cells. Crossing over allows for the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, while independent assortment shuffles the chromosomes randomly. This results in offspring with different combinations of genes, contributing to genetic variation within a species."

	      ],
	      "wordAnswer": "Carrying genetic information",
	      "explanation": "Chromosomes play a crucial role in cell division by carrying genetic information. Chromosomes are thread-like structures composed of DNA and proteins. They contain the genes that encode the instructions for building and maintaining an organism. During cell division, the chromosomes replicate and separate, ensuring that each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic information. This process ensures the transmission of genetic traits from one generation to the next."

	      "wordAnswer": "Being produced by meiosis",
	      "explanation": "Haploid cells are characterized by being produced by meiosis. Meiosis is a type of cell division that occurs in specialized cells called germ cells to produce gametes (sperm and eggs). The process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in haploid cells. Haploid cells have only one set of chromosomes, representing half of the genetic information. In humans, haploid cells have 23 chromosomes."

	      ],
	      "wordAnswer": "Having two sets of chromosomes",
	      "explanation": "Diploid cells are characterized by having two sets of chromosomes. In most organisms, including humans, diploid cells have two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from each parent. The diploid number of chromosomes represents the complete set of genetic information for an organism. Diploid cells are produced through the process of fertilization when haploid gametes (sperm and egg) fuse."

	      "explanation": "The process of meiosis occurs in germ cells. Germ cells are specialized cells that give rise to gametes (sperm and eggs) in organisms that reproduce sexually. Meiosis is a two-step division process that involves a reduction in chromosome number and genetic recombination. It ensures that each gamete receives only one set of chromosomes, which is necessary for sexual reproduction and the fusion of gametes to restore the diploid number during fertilization."

	      ],
	      "wordAnswer": "Anchoring spindle fibers",
	      "explanation": "During mitosis and meiosis, spindle fibers attach to the centromere via protein structures called kinetochores. These spindle fibers help separate the replicated chromosomes and pull them toward opposite poles of the dividing cell."

	      ],
	      "wordAnswer": "Nuclear envelope breaks down",
	      "explanation": "During prophase of mitosis, the nuclear envelope, which encloses the nucleus, breaks down. This breakdown allows the mitotic spindle to access the chromosomes. \n\nChromosomes align at the cell equator during metaphase. \n\nSister chromatids separate during anaphase. \n\nCytokinesis occurs after mitosis."

	      "wordAnswer": "Division of the cytoplasm to form two separate daughter cells",
	      "explanation": "Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division and involves the division of the cytoplasm to form two separate daughter cells. After the duplicated chromosomes have separated and new nuclei have formed, the cell undergoes cytokinesis to ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic material and organelles. Cytokinesis differs between animal and plant cells, with animal cells typically undergoing cleavage furrow formation and plant cells forming a cell plate."

	      "wordAnswer": "Division of a diploid cell into two identical diploid daughter cells",
	      "explanation": "Mitosis is a type of cell division that occurs in somatic cells (non-reproductive cells). It involves the division of a diploid cell, which has a complete set of chromosomes (two sets of chromosomes), into two identical diploid daughter cells. During mitosis, the replicated chromosomes align, separate, and are distributed equally to each daughter cell. This process ensures the maintenance of the chromosome number and genetic stability in the resulting cells."

	      "wordAnswer": "Mitosis results in the formation of diploid cells, while meiosis results in the formation of haploid cells",
	      "explanation": "Mitosis is a cell division process that produces two genetically identical daughter cells with the same chromosome number as the parent cell. It is involved in growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in organisms. On the other hand, meiosis is a specialized cell division process that occurs in reproductive cells and results in the formation of haploid cells (gametes).

	      "explanation": "Meiosis is significant in organisms because it prevents the doubling of the chromosome number from one generation to the next. During meiosis, the chromosome number is reduced by half, resulting in the formation of haploid cells (gametes) with half the chromosome number of the parent cells. When these haploid cells combine during fertilization, the chromosome number is restored, leading to the formation of a diploid zygote. This process helps maintain the stability of the chromosome number in each generation."

It does not involve the visible condensation of chromosomes.\n- Telophase: Telophase is the final stage of mitosis when chromosomes reach opposite poles of the cell and decondense. Chromosomes are no longer thick and visible during this stage.\n- Anaphase: Anaphase is the stage in mitosis when sister chromatids separate and move towards opposite poles of the cell. Chromosomes are not condensed and thickened during anaphase."
