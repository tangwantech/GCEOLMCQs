            "Damp, hot and no wind"
         ],
         "wordAnswer":"Windy, hot and dry",
         "explanation":"The presence of wind increases the rate of transpiration in plants by creating a higher concentration gradient between the plant's leaves and the surrounding air. Hot and dry conditions further enhance water loss as the dry air absorbs moisture from the plant's leaves."

            "Hairy, vertebrate and cold blooded"
         ],
         "wordAnswer":"Vertebrate, scaly and cold blooded",
         "explanation":"Reptiles are vertebrates, meaning they have a backbone. They are also characterized by their scaly skin, which provides protection and helps reduce water loss. Reptiles are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature is dependent on the external environment."
      },
      {
         "questionNumber":"3",

            "Deoxygenated, rich in food and under high pressure."
         ],
         "wordAnswer":"Deoxygenated, poor in food and under low pressure.",
         "explanation":"The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenation. It is poor in food (nutrients) because nutrients are mainly transported through the systemic circulation. The blood in the pulmonary artery is under low pressure as it is pumped from the right ventricle of the heart."

         ],
         "wordAnswer":"Bend towards the light source.",
         "explanation":"Phototropism is the growth response of plants to light. When a shoot is illuminated on one side, it produces a hormone called auxin, which causes the cells on the shaded side to elongate. This differential growth results in the shoot bending towards the light source."
      },

         ],
         "wordAnswer":"Pancreas.",
         "explanation":"Trypsin is an enzyme involved in the digestion of proteins. It is produced and secreted by the pancreas into the small intestine (duodenum) in its inactive form, trypsinogen. Once in the intestine, trypsinogen is activated to trypsin, which then helps break down proteins into smaller peptide fragments."

            "It is the cocoon."
          ],
          "wordAnswer": "It feeds heavily.",
          "explanation": "The correct answer is 'It feeds heavily.' Stage X in the life cycle of a housefly is the larval stage, also known as the maggot stage. During this stage, the larva feeds heavily to grow and develop. The other options are incorrect because stage X is not segmented, dormant, or the cocoon."

            "Epidermal cells."
          ],
          "wordAnswer": "A cuticle",
          "explanation": "The correct answer is 'A cuticle' because adult insects are covered by a waxy and waterproof layer called the cuticle. This cuticle provides protection and helps prevent water loss. The other options, such as scales, hairy skin, or epidermal cells, are not correct descriptions of the outer covering of adult insects."
        },

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Kidney",
          "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Kidney' because the production of urine in mammals primarily occurs in the kidneys. The kidneys filter waste products and excess water from the blood, producing urine as a result. The other options, such as testis, bladder, or ureter, are not directly involved in urine production."

            "Anthers"
          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Anthers",
          "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Anthers' because pollen grains, which contain the male reproductive cells, are produced in the anthers of a flower. The anthers are part of the stamen, the male reproductive organ of a flower. The other options, such as stigma, ovary, or pollen, are not the correct sites of pollen grain production."

            "Pupil only"
          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Iris and pupil",
          "explanation": "The amount of light entering the eye is controlled by the iris and pupil. The iris regulates the size of the pupil, which determines the amount of light that enters the eye."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Cornea, humour and lens",
          "explanation": "The refraction of light in the eye is done by the cornea, humor, and lens. The cornea and lens help to bend and focus light onto the retina, allowing us to see objects clearly."

            "Hawk"
          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Hawk",
          "explanation": "In the given food web, a tertiary consumer is an animal that feeds on secondary consumers. Hawk is the correct answer because it is the only option that is positioned at the top of the food chain and preys on other animals, making it a tertiary consumer. The other options, such as Toad, Rat, and Hen, are positioned lower in the food chain and are either primary or secondary consumers."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Head, thorax and abdomen.",
          "explanation": "The body of an adult insect is divided into three main parts: Head, thorax, and abdomen. These parts are distinct and serve different functions. The head contains sensory organs and mouthparts, the thorax is where the legs and wings are attached, and the abdomen houses the digestive, reproductive, and respiratory systems. The other options do not accurately represent the division of the insect's body."

            "Renal tubules"
          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Glomerulus",
          "explanation": "Ultra-filtration, the process of filtering blood to form urine, takes place in the glomerulus of the mammalian kidney. The glomerulus is a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries that allow small molecules, such as water, salts, and waste products, to pass through while retaining larger molecules like proteins and blood cells. The other options, such as Medulla, Pelvis, and Renal tubules, are not directly involved in the process of ultra-filtration."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Dendron",
          "explanation": "The part X in the given diagram represents a dendron, which is a long, branched extension of a neuron. Dendrons receive incoming signals from other neurons or sensory receptors and transmit them towards the cell body. They play a crucial role in relaying information within the nervous system. The other options, such as Axon, Cell body, and Receptor, represent different components of a neuron and are not specifically depicted in the diagram."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Giving time for cellulose to be digested.",
          "explanation": "Herbivorous mammals have long guts to facilitate the digestion of cellulose, a complex carbohydrate found in plant cell walls. The lengthy digestive system provides time for cellulose to be digested by the action of specialized microorganisms, such as bacteria, that live in the gut. This process allows herbivores to extract nutrients from plant material that would otherwise be indigestible. The other options, such as Storing food, Regurgitation, and Grinding food, do not accurately explain the purpose of a herbivorous mammal's long gut."

          "explanation": "A virus is a parasite. It is an infectious agent that requires a host cell to replicate. The statement 'Can contain DNA and RNA' is not correct because viruses can have either DNA or RNA as their genetic material but not both. The statement 'Has a nuclear membrane' is incorrect because viruses do not have a true nuclear membrane like eukaryotic cells."

          "wordAnswer": "1 and 2 only are correct",
          "explanation": "Biotic factors in an ecosystem can have favorable effects. Pollination is one such effect, as it enables the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organs of a flower to the female reproductive organs, leading to fertilization and reproduction. Decomposition of dead organic matter is also beneficial as it recycles nutrients back into the ecosystem. However, eutrophication is not a favorable effect but rather an excessive nutrient enrichment that can lead to harmful algal blooms and oxygen depletion in aquatic ecosystems."

          "explanation": "The correct answer is 1/2 of the offspring are black. In this scenario, black fur is dominant over grey fur, and the heterozygous black mouse carries one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (b). When crossed with a grey mouse carrying two recessive alleles (bb), the possible genotypes of the offspring are Bb and bb. The Bb genotype represents black fur, while the bb genotype represents grey fur. Therefore, half of the offspring (1/2) will have black fur, and the other half will have grey fur."

By subjecting the leaf to boiling water, the heat denatures and deactivates enzymes present in the leaf tissue. This is important because enzymes are responsible for catalyzing the conversion of glucose to starch during photosynthesis. By stopping all chemical reactions through boiling, any starch present in the leaf will be preserved and can be detected through subsequent staining or testing methods."

          "explanation": "The correct answer is Stored food being used. At the beginning of seed germination, there is a drop in the dry mass of the seed because stored food is being used. During germination, the embryo within the seed relies on the stored reserves of nutrients, such as starch, proteins, and lipids, to fuel its growth and development until it can establish a functional root system and start photosynthesis. As the embryo utilizes these stored food reserves, the dry mass of the seed decreases. This process ensures that the developing seedling has the necessary energy and nutrients to sustain its early growth."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "The leguminous plants increase the nitrogen content of the soil.",
          "explanation": "The correct answer is 'The leguminous plants increase the nitrogen content of the soil.' This is because leguminous plants have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nodules. These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use, which is then absorbed by the roots of the leguminous plants. This extra nitrogen is beneficial for the growth and development of surrounding plants, such as maize. The increased nitrogen content in the soil promotes greener and healthier growth of the maize plant."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "It is produced in tissue respiration.",
          "explanation": "The correct answer is 'It is produced in tissue respiration.' When we breathe in, oxygen is taken up by the body's cells during cellular respiration, which produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. This carbon dioxide is then transported back to the lungs through the bloodstream and exhaled during expiration. Therefore, the percentage of carbon dioxide in expired air is higher than that in inspired air because it is a byproduct of the body's metabolic processes, particularly tissue respiration."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Presence of dissolved chemicals in the atmosphere.",
          "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Presence of dissolved chemicals in the atmosphere.' In industrial areas, there are often high levels of air pollution, which includes various chemicals and pollutants. These pollutants can react with the moisture in the air to form corrosive substances, such as acids. When these corrosive substances come into contact with the roofs of houses, they can cause corrosion and damage over time. Therefore, the presence of dissolved chemicals in the atmosphere is the primary reason for the corrosion of roofs in industrial areas."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "High rate of transpiration and little water uptake.",
          "explanation": "The correct answer is 'High rate of transpiration and little water uptake.' When a newly transplanted seedling is exposed to high light intensity and high temperature on a sunny day, it leads to an increased rate of transpiration. Transpiration is the process by which water is lost from the leaves of plants through small openings called stomata. If the seedling is not able to take up enough water from the soil to compensate for the water loss through transpiration, it can result in wilting. Therefore, the wilting of a newly transplanted, well-watered seedling on a sunny day is primarily due to the combination of a high rate of transpiration and little water uptake."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Growth of fungal spores from the air.",
          "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Growth of fungal spores from the air.' Bread left on the kitchen window for two days tends to develop mold due to the presence of fungal spores in the air. Fungal spores are tiny reproductive structures produced by fungi, and they can be found in the environment, including the air. When bread is exposed to moisture and favorable conditions, such as warmth, these fungal spores can land on the bread's surface and start to grow. As they grow, they form visible mold patches, which are composed of fungal hyphae. Therefore, the growth of fungal spores from the air is the primary reason why bread left on the kitchen window for two days molds. The other options are incorrect because decay by bacteria, absorption of moisture, and decomposition by viruses and bacteria are not the main causes of mold growth in this scenario."

          "wordAnswer": "Enzymes are denatured at very high temperature.",
          "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Enzymes are denatured at very high temperature.' The graph shows that as the temperature increases, the rate of the enzyme-controlled reaction initially increases, reaches an optimum point, and then starts to decrease. At very high temperatures, enzymes can become denatured. Denaturation is a process in which the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme is disrupted, leading to a loss of its function. The other options are incorrect because an increase in temperature doesn't always increase the rate of the reaction, enzymes are not active at all temperatures, and enzymes are not simply inactive at very high temperatures but rather denatured."
