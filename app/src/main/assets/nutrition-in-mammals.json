          "wordAnswer": "Reducing sugar",
          "explanation": "Reducing sugars have the ability to reduce soluble Cu2+ ions in Benedict's solution to insoluble Cu(I) oxide which precipitates out of solution, producing the orange-red colour. The colour change observed will depend on the concentration of reducing sugar present in the food sample.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Protein, starch and fats do not react with Benedicts solution."

          "wordAnswer": "Stomach",
          "explanation": "The stomach is the region of the alimentary canal with the lowest pH of about 2.0. This low pH is due to the presence of hydrochloric acid (HCL) in the gastric juice it secretes. This low pH is important for the activation and functioning of the enzymes that work in the stomach"

It regulates the release of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum, allowing for controlled digestion and absorption of nutrients.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Cardiac sphincter prevents backflow of food from the stomach into the esophagus.\n\n- The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that prevents food from entering the trachea during swallowing.\n\n- Pancreas is not involved in regulating the release of chyme from the stomach into the duodenum."

          "explanation": "Bile helps to emulsify fats in the small intestine, breaking them down into smaller droplets that can be more easily digested by enzymes. This process increases the surface area of the fat, allowing for more efficient digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins."

It covers the opening of the trachea, directing food and liquids into the esophagus while ensuring that they do not enter the airway and cause choking or aspiration.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- The glottis refers to the opening into the trachea which is blocked by the epiglottis during swallowing.\n\n- The esophagus is a muscular tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.\n\n- The larynx, or voice box, is involved in sound production."

It is then stored and concentrated in the gallbladder before being released into the duodenum to aid in the digestion and absorption of fats.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine where bile is released, but it is not the organ that produces bile.\n\n- While the pancreas produces digestive enzymes and hormones, it does not produce bile.\n\n- The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile but does not produce it."

          "explanation": "Heterotrophic nutrition is one in which some organisms feed on ready made organic food substances because they cannot manufacture their own food. Parasitism and Saprophytism are types of heterotrophic nutrition.\n\n In parasitism, one organism called a parasite lives inside or on the body of another organism called the host, obtaining all its nutrients from the host.\n\n In saprophytism an organism (saprophyte) feeds on dead decaying organic matter by secreting extracellular enzymes into the organic matter (substrate). The enzymes digest the substrate and the saprophyte absorbs the end product of digestion into its body.\n\n- Photosynthesis is a type of autotrophic nutrition, not heterotrophic nutrition. In all forms of autotrophic nutrition, the autotroph is able to manufacture its own organic food material like carbohydrates from simple inorganic raw materials like carbon dioxide and water."

It is commonly observed in animals like cows and sheep, which have complex stomachs with multiple chambers to aid in the digestion of plant material.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth and is not related to rumination.\n\n- Caecotrophy is the process of re-ingesting soft, partially digested fecal pellets to extract additional nutrients and is not the same as rumination.\n\n- Egestion is the process of eliminating undigested food materials from the body and is not related to rumination."

Carnivores are animals that primarily consume other animals as part of their diet.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Omnivores have a more varied diet, including both plant and animal material, and may not have canines specifically adapted for piercing and tearing flesh.\n\n- Herbivores primarily consume plant material and usually have teeth adapted for grinding and processing plant matter, not for piercing and tearing flesh.\n\n- Ruminants are a subgroup of herbivores with a specialized digestive system for processing plant material, and their canines are not typically adapted for piercing and tearing flesh."
