          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Caterpillar",
          "explanation": "In the given food chain, the herbivore is the organism that consumes plants. As the caterpillar directly feeds on the cabbage, which is a plant, it is considered the herbivore.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n- 'Hen' consumes Caterpillar, making it a carnivore (secondary consumer).\n- 'Hawk' is also a carnivore (tertiary consumer) as it feeds on hen.\n- 'Cabbage' is a producer."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Adrenal gland",
          "explanation": "The adrenal gland produces the hormone called adrenaline (epinephrine). Adrenaline increases the rate of heart beat. This helps to supplies nutrients and oxygen faster to the skeletal muscles, in preparation for action. Secretion of adrenaline usually occurs during fight, flight or fright:\n\n- The thyroid gland produces hormones thyroxine that regulates metabolism.\n\n- The pancreas produces insulin and glucagon which are hormones involved in regulating blood sugar levels.\n\n- The pituitary gland produces various hormones that control other endocrine glands, but they do not directly increase the rate of heart beat."

          "explanation": "When a couple with genotypes BO and AB have children, the possible genotypes of the children would be: 1/4 AB, 1/ 4 BB, 1/4 BO and 1/4 AO. The genotypes BB and BO represent blood group B. Therefore the probability of having a child of blood group B is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Even distribution of auxin",
          "explanation": "When a bean seedling is placed on a rotating klinostat, it grows straight upwards because of the even distribution of auxin. Auxin is a plant hormone that promotes cell elongation and growth in shoots. When the klinostat rotates, it prevents the accumulation of auxin on any particular side of the seedling. This leads to balanced growth and the seedling grows straight upwards."

          "wordAnswer": "Fast growth of axillary buds",
          "explanation": "When the terminal bud of a tomato plant is cut off, it stimulates the fast growth of axillary buds. The terminal bud is responsible for suppressing the growth of axillary buds by producing a hormone called auxin. When the terminal bud is removed, the inhibition of axillary buds is released, leading to their rapid growth. This is a common horticultural practice known as pinching to encourage bushier growth in plants."

          "wordAnswer": "Plants convert solar energy into chemical energy",
          "explanation": "Plants are autotrophic. They have the ability to convert sunlight into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. This energy is then transferred to organisms at higher trophic levels through consumption. Without plants, there would be no source of energy for the rest of the organisms in a food chain, making plants essential for sustaining life on Earth."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Contains carbon dioxide",
          "explanation": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced as a waste product of cellular respiration in living organisms. When exhaled air is bubbled through lime water, the carbon dioxide it contains reacts with the lime water or calcium hydroxide to form a white precipitate called calcium carbonate, which gives the milky appearance. This reaction is known as the lime water test for carbon dioxide.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n- Exhaled air does not contain carbon monoxide or nitrogen oxide, and these gases do not cause lime water to turn milky.\n- While exhaled air contains oxygen, the oxygen cannot cause lime water to turn milky."

          "wordAnswer": "Anaerobic respiration by yeast",
          "explanation": "Exposed palm wine loses its sweetness after several hours due to anaerobic respiration by yeast. When palm wine is exposed to air, yeast present in the environment can contaminate it. These yeast cells metabolize the sugars present in the palm wine through anaerobic respiration, converting them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process is known as fermentation. As a result, the sweetness of the palm wine decreases as the sugars are converted into alcohol. The palm wine becomes sour."
