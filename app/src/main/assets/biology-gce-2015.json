          "wordAnswer": "Scaly skin",
          "explanation": "The scaly skin of the Agama lizard serves as a protective adaptation in a terrestrial habitat. It helps to reduce water loss, provides physical protection against predators, and aids in thermoregulation. \n\n Claws, Gular fold, and Nuchal crest may also have specific functions but are not primarily protective adaptations."

          "wordAnswer": "Glomerulus",
          "explanation": "Ultra-filtration takes place in the Glomerulus. The Glomerulus is a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries that filter waste products and excess water from the blood. \nThe other options are wrong because:\n\n- Bowman's capsule is the structure that surrounds the Glomerulus and collects the filtered fluid.\n\n- Proximal convoluted tubule is the structure where reabsorption of important substances from the filtrate occurs.\n\n- Collecting duct is responsible for further concentration of urine and not the initial filtration."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Ovule",
          "explanation": "The ovule contains the female reproductive cells and is located within the ovary of the flower. After fertilization, the ovule develops into a seed, which contains the embryo of the plant.The other options are wrong because: \n\n- The ovary develops into the fruit of the flower and no the seed.\n\n- The stigma is the sticky structure at the top of the pistil that receives pollen during pollination.\n\n- The sepal is the outermost part of the flower that protects the bud before it blooms. The sepal withers and falls off after fertilization."

          "wordAnswer": "1 and 2",
          "explanation": "The cell body of a motor neuron consists of both the dendron (1) and the cell body itself (2). The dendron is responsible for receiving signals from other neurons, while the cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles necessary for the neuron's functioning. \n\n- 3, 4 and 5 refer to the axon, node of Ranvier and  myelin sheath respectively. They are not parts of the cell body."

          "wordAnswer": "Fovea",
          "explanation": "The fovea, a portion of the retina contains a high concentration of cones. Cones are photoreceptor cells responsible for color vision and high visual acuity. The other options are wrong because:\n\n- Sclera is the white outer layer of the eye. It lacks photoreceptor cells.\n\n- Choroid is the layer behind the retina that provides nourishment to the eye.\n\n- Blind spot is the area where the optic nerve exits the eye and lacks photoreceptor cells."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Shark",
          "explanation": " The shark, being a tertiary consumer, is at a higher trophic level and has the least total stored energy among the given options. In an energy pyramid, each level represents a trophic level in an ecosystem, with energy transfer occurring from one level to the next. Algae (Producer) has the highest amount of stored energy as it directly converts solar energy into chemical energy. As we move up the pyramid, energy is transferred and lost, resulting in less total stored energy at higher levels."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Transport fatty acids and glycerol or fat.",
          "explanation": "The structure labeled T (lacteal) on the diagram is responsible for transporting fatty acids and glycerol or fat. Lacteals are specialized lymphatic capillaries found in the villi of the small intestine. They play a crucial role in absorbing dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system and transporting them to the bloodstream for further distribution and utilization by the body. \n\n Amino acids and glucose are primarily absorbed by the blood capillaries in the villi of the small intestine."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Knee joint",
          "explanation": "A hinge joint is a joint that allows movement in only one direction, like a door hinge. The Knee joint is an example of a hinge joint, allowing flexion and extension of the leg. \n\n- Shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint that allows a wide range of movement.\n\n- Wrist joint is a condyloid joint that allows for flexion, extension, circumduction.\n\n- Ankle joint is not a hinge joint."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Medulla oblongata",
          "explanation": "The Medulla oblongata controls vital involuntary functions such as the regulation of heart rate and breathing rate. \n\n- Cerebrum is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as thinking, memory, and perception.\n\n- Cerebellum is involved in coordinating movement and balance.\n\n- Hypothalamus is responsible for regulating body temperature, hunger, thirst, and hormone production."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Septum",
          "explanation": "The septum is a wall of muscle that divides the heart into the left and right sides, preventing mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. \n\n- Bicuspid valve prevents backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium.\n\n- Tendons are fibrous connective tissues that attach muscles to bones.\n\n- Tricuspid valve prevents backflow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium."

Animal cells do not have chloroplasts and therefore cannot carry out photosynthesis. \n\n -The cell wall made of cellulose, is a characteristic feature of plant cells. It provides structural support. \n\n -Starch grains are storage polysaccharides found in plant cells. Its equivalence in animal cells is glycogen."

          "explanation": "When Fehling's solution is added to ground germinating maize seed paste and heated, a brick red color will be observed. Fehling's solution is used to test for the presence of reducing sugars. During germination, stored food reserves (starch) are hydrolysed to glucose (reducing sugar. The glucose is used during tissue respiration to produce energy for growth and other activities. In the presence of reducing sugars, such as glucose, Fehling's solution undergoes a chemical reaction that results in the formation of a brick red precipitate."
