          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Liver",
          "explanation": "Deamination occurs in the liver. The liver cells are able to remove the amino group from amino acids to form ammonia, a process called deamination. In terrestrial animals such as man, the ammonia is immediately converted to urea in the liver. Urea is less toxic, less soluble than ammonia and require less water for its elimination."

          ],
          "wordAnswer": "Causes Eutrophication.",
          "explanation": "Untreated sewage in water causes eutrophication. Untreated sewage is reach in nutrients. When deposited into a water body, it leads to rapid growth of algae, a condition called algal bloom. When these algae die, they are decomposed by aerobic bacteria. This decomposition requires the use of large amount of dissolved oxygen in the water body. Other aquatic organisms are deprived of oxygen. They eventually suffocate and die"

The alveolus is highly vascularized to carry oxygen away from it to the tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the alveolus. This transport helps to maintain a steep diffusion gradient across the alveolus. \n\n- A good respiratory surface does not have a thick epithelium as it will greatly reduce the rate of diffusion of respiratory gases."

Arteries have thicker walls than veins because they contain more smooth muscles and elastic fibers. The smooth muscles and elastic fibers enable the arteries to withstand high pressure of blood coming from the heart. \n\n- Arteries do not have valves. Valves are generally found in veins where they help to prevent backflow of blood."

The rhizobium fixes nitrogen from the air into a form that the plant can use, while the plant provides the bacteria with carbohydrates and a protected environment in its roots. Commensalism is a relationship where one organism benefits while the other is unaffected. Parasitism is a relationship where one organism benefits at the expense of the other. Predation is a relationship where one organism kills and eats another."

Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas are involved in nitrification, which converts ammonia to nitrites and nitrites to nitrates, respectively. Azobacter is a nitrogen-fixing bacteria that converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which plants can use."

The possible combinations for their offspring are A (2%), AB (50%) and B (25%). It's not possible for them to have offspring with blood group O, which requires two O alleles."

        "wordAnswer": "To kill the protoplasm.",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is 'To kill the protoplasm.' Killing the protoplasm stops any further metabolic processes that could alter the starch content, ensuring an accurate measurement of the starch already present in the leaf. Removing chlorophyll, activating enzymes, or converting glucose to starch are not the primary reasons for boiling the leaf."

        "wordAnswer": "To kill fungal spores on the grains.",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is 'To kill fungal spores on the grains.' Sodium oxo chlorate is a disinfectant that kills fungi and bacteria. This is important to ensure that any heat produced during germination is solely due to the seeds' metabolic activity and not from microbial activity. Increasing germination rate, preventing oxygen entry, and absorbing carbon dioxide are not the primary reasons for using sodium oxo chlorate."

In epigeal germination, the hypocotyl elongates and pushes the cotyledons and plumule above the soil surface. The epicotyl is the part of the stem above the cotyledons, and it elongates later in development. The plumule and radicle are embryonic structures that develop into the shoot and root, respectively."

        "wordAnswer": "Absorb much water, swell and burst.",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Absorb much water, swell and burst.' Marine amoebas are adapted to a saltwater environment, which has a higher salt concentration than their cells. When placed in freshwater, which has a lower salt concentration, water will move into the amoeba by osmosis, causing it to swell and eventually burst. Dehydration, contractile vacuole development, and pseudopodia formation are not the primary responses of marine amoebas to freshwater."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is 'They suffocated and died due to lack of oxygen.' Excess fertilizer can lead to eutrophication, a process where excessive nutrients cause rapid growth of algae and other plants. This plant growth depletes oxygen in the water, leading to suffocation of other organisms. Rapid growth, predator exposure, and increased numbers are not typical consequences of fertilizer pollution."

        "wordAnswer": "Release of egg from the ovary.",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Release of egg from the ovary.' Estrogen levels surge just before ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), which typically occurs around Day 14 of a menstrual cycle. This surge triggers the final maturation of the egg and prepares the uterus for potential implantation. \n\n The other options are incorrect: Thickening of the uterine wall happens after ovulation, in response to progesterone.\n\n Development of corpus luteum occurs after ovulation, as the follicle that released the egg transforms into the corpus luteum. \n\n Peeling off of the uterine wall (menstruation) happens if fertilization does not occur, typically around Day 28 of a cycle."

        "wordAnswer": "Vasodilation.",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Vasodilation.' Vasodilation is the widening of blood vessels, which allows more blood to flow near the skin's surface, facilitating heat loss through radiation and sweating. \n\n The other options are incorrect because: Increased metabolism generates heat, not loses it.\n\n Shivering is a mechanism to generate heat, not lose it.\n\n Vasoconstriction is the narrowing of blood vessels, which conserves heat, not loses it."
