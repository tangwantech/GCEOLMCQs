          "wordAnswer": "Fermentation",
          "explanation": "Anaerobic respiration of yeast in sugar solution is known as fermentation. During fermentation, yeast converts sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide in the absence of oxygen. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- While reduction and oxidation do take place during anaerobic respiration of yeast, however, the overall process is known as fermentation.\n\n- Decomposition is a general process that involves the break down of dead organic matter into simpler ones. It requires the use of oxygen."

          "wordAnswer": "C6H12O6",
          "explanation": "The general formula CnH2nOn can be used to obtain the chemical formula of any monosaccharide. Glucose is an example of a hexose sugar, where n = 6. Therefore substituting n with 6 in the general formula gives C6H12O6. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- C2H5OH is the formula for ethanol.\n\n- C12H22O11 is the formula for sucrose, an example of a disaccharide.\n\n- C57H104O6 represents a triglyceride."

          "wordAnswer": "Reduce water loss",
          "explanation": "Both leaf and insect exoskeleton are adapted to reduce water loss by having a waxy waterproof cuticle.\n\n- While insect exoskeleton can provide camouflage, the leaf does not.\n\n- While insect exoskeleton can contain sensory cells, it is not common of leaf surfaces.\n- 'While a leaf assists in respiration, insect exoskeleton has no direct role in respiration."
