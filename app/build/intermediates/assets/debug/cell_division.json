		      "wordAnswer": "It creates genetic diversity",
		      "explanation": "Meiosis involves two rounds of cell division, resulting in the production of four non-identical daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell, leading to genetic diversity. During meiosis, crossing over between homologous chromosomes and random assortment further creates genetic diversity.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Meiosis does not results in identical daughter cells, but non-identical daughter cells due to genetic recombination.\n\n- Meiosis is not involved in tissue repair. This is the function of mitosis.\n\n- Meiosis is associated with sexual reproduction, not asexual reproduction."

This ensures that each daughter cell receives the correct number of chromosomes. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- The centromere does not regulate cell growth or produce energy.\n\n- The primary function of the centromere during cell division is to anchor spindle fibers.

		      "wordAnswer": "Nuclear envelope breaks down",
		      "explanation": "During prophase of mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down, allowing the chromosomes to be exposed and interact with the spindle fibers. This is a crucial step in preparing the chromosomes for alignment and subsequent division. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Chromosomes aligning at the cell equator occurs during metaphase, not prophase.\n\n- Sister chromatids separate during anaphase, not prophase.\n\n- Cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, occurs after mitosis is complete."

		      "explanation": "Cytokinesis is the process of dividing the cytoplasm to form two separate daughter cells after the genetic material has been divided during mitosis or meiosis. It ensures that each daughter cell receives the necessary cellular components to function independently. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Cytokinesis is not involved in the separation of homologous chromosomes; this occurs during anaphase of meiosis I.\n\n- Formation of new nuclei occurs during telophase.\n\n- DNA replication takes place during the S phase of the cell cycle, which is separate from cytokinesis."

		      "wordAnswer": "Generating genetic diversity",
		      "explanation": "Crossing over during meiosis is essential for generating genetic diversity among the resulting daughter cells. This process involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, leading to new combinations of alleles and increasing genetic variability. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Producing identical daughter cells is not the purpose of crossing over; in fact, it contributes to genetic variation among the daughter cells.\n\n- Crossing over does not increase the number of chromosomes; it redistributes genetic information between homologous chromosomes.\n\n- While cells have mechanisms to repair damaged DNA, crossing over primarily serves to increase genetic diversity."

		      "explanation": "Chromosomes are structures that carry genetic information in the form of genes, DNA, and associated proteins. They are visible during cell division and are essential for the accurate transmission of genetic material to daughter cells. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- While enzymes are involved in cell division, chromosomes themselves are not enzymes.\n\n- Proteins responsible for DNA replication are enzymes, not chromosomes.\n\n- Chromosomes are not organelles.

		      "wordAnswer": "Division of a cell into two genetically identical daughter cells",
		      "explanation": "The process of mitosis involves the division of a cell into two genetically identical daughter cells. This ensures that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes and genetic material, supporting growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in multicellular organisms. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Mitosis does not result in the division of a cell into four daughter cells; that process is characteristic of meiosis.\n\n- While meiosis results in the formation of haploid daughter cells, mitosis leads to the formation of diploid daughter cells.\n\n- The purpose of mitosis is to produce genetically identical daughter cells, not non-identical daughter cells."

This is the main difference between the two processes. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Mitosis results in the formation of diploid cells, not haploid cells, while meiosis results in the formation of haploid cells, not diploid cells.\n\n- Mitosis involves one round of cell division, while meiosis involves two rounds of cell division.\n\n- Mitosis is important in asexual reproduction, while meiosis is important in sexual reproduction."

		      "explanation": "Meiosis involves two rounds of nuclear division, resulting in the formation of four daughter cells, each with a haploid set of chromosomes. This process is essential for sexual reproduction and the generation of genetic diversity.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Mitosis involves a single round of nuclear division, resulting in the formation of two genetically identical daughter cells.\n\n- Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm following nuclear division and is not directly related to the number of nuclear divisions.\n\n- The term cell division is broad and encompasses both mitosis and meiosis."

They play a crucial role in the organization and transmission of genetic information during cell division and cell reproduction.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Spindle fibers are microtubule structures involved in the movement of chromosomes during cell division. They do not consist of nucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins.\n\n- Centrioles are cylindrical structures involved in the organization of microtubules and are not composed of nucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins.\n\n- The nucleolus is a subnuclear structure within the nucleus involved in ribosome biogenesis and does not consist of nucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins."

		      "explanation": "Meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids, which ensures that each of the resulting daughter cells receives the same haploid number of chromosomes. This stage is essential for the production of haploid daughter cells with genetic variation.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n- The separation of homologous chromosomes occurs during Meiosis I, not Meiosis II.\n- Meiosis II, like Meiosis I, leads to the formation of genetically diverse daughter cells, not genetically identical ones.\n\n- Crossing over occurs during Meiosis I and is not directly related to the purpose of Meiosis II."
